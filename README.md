A fun and educational WebXR dark ride into the Ice Age of Southern California!

## Highlights:
* Part One is released with a scale model of downtown LA, and three (or is it four?) of the La Brea Tar Pits animals placed in a recreation of a pinion-juniper woodland. 
* WebXR experience is free and works on web browsers in VR and on desktop and smartphones.
* Three narration tracks! Choose from the theme park ride Adventure, the informative Educational, or the behind-the-scenes Developer's Commentary. Or no narration at all.
* Ride is slow-paced and on even ground for VR comfort
* Additional comfort feature of being able to see the track up ahead
* Reverse-comfort feature for VR pros: turn off the car for an unobstructed view
